## Project Overview

HUMAN 2.0 is an ambitious AI development project designed to create a sophisticated autonomous AI system capable of self-improvement, knowledge processing, and code analysis. The project draws inspiration from human brain structures, with components named after brain regions (Brainstem, Cerebral Cortex, Basal Ganglia) to reflect their functional roles within the system.

The core vision of HUMAN 2.0 is to develop an AI that can:
- Process and understand complex information
- Learn continuously from various sources
- Analyze and modify its own code
- Make logical decisions with emotional intelligence
- Achieve full autonomy through self-improvement

This comprehensive approach combines task automation (AutoGPT), memory management (LangChain, ChromaDB), emotional intelligence (Sentiment-Llama), visual processing (YOLO/Detectron2), self-improvement capabilities (RLHF, automated debugging), and continuous learning (Knowledge Graphs, automated research).

## Architecture

HUMAN 2.0 is structured around three primary neural components:

### 1. Brainstem (Core System)
- Task planning and execution
- System memory management
- Basic command processing
- Component control (start/stop/status)

### 2. Cerebral Cortex (Knowledge Processing)
- Document understanding (PDFs, books, papers)
- OCR processing for scanned documents
- Vector storage for knowledge (using ChromaDB/Pinecone)
- Natural language understanding

### 3. Basal Ganglia (Code Analysis)
- Code understanding and modification
- Pattern detection in code
- Self-improvement capabilities
- Learning from code repositories

The system is accessible through multiple interfaces:
- Command line with various options (`python main.py --command [run|initialize|status|interactive]`)
- Interactive terminal supporting both direct commands and natural language input
- Component-specific interfaces for specialized tasks

## Current Status

The project has established the foundational architecture with the three core neural components. Current implemented capabilities include:

- System initialization and component management
- Basic task management system
- Interactive terminal with command processing
- Component status monitoring
- Initial implementation of knowledge processing mechanisms
- Document reading and understanding capabilities
- Vector storage integration for knowledge retention
- Code analysis foundations

The system can currently:
- Start, stop, and check status of components
- Process natural language commands
- Initialize the learning and processing systems
- Manage basic tasks and memory
- Begin knowledge acquisition and storage
